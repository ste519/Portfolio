                            <h3>Overview </h3>
                            <p>Name: Waitless</p>
                            <p>Format: Web App
                            <p>Platform: mobile (preferred Pixel 2 or iPhone 6/7/8 Plus) </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>As we previously observed, with limited information, UCSD students struggle to find food efficiently under time restrictions. Therefore, our team decide to create an app for the current UCSD community to enhance their dining experience by making the food selection process easier and more efficient. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The web app “Waitless” have two major functionalities: “Wait Time Ranking” and “Favorites List”.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Wait Time Ranking: displays wait time ranked from least to the most</p>
                            <p>First, the user will be shown the current system time. The sorted list of restaurants from the least waiting time to the most will be displayed. This allows our user to access the information within seconds without complicated navigations. Adding on to the current wait time, the user can click on any one of the restaurants to go to the page that shows estimated wait times of specific restaurants. Or, the user can click on the time button to select a preferred time to see the projected wait times, also in sorted order from least to most.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Favorites List: stores favorite restaurants</p>
                            <p>In the current wait time/estimated wait time page, if the user clicks on the little heart button next to the wait time, that specific restaurant will be stored to local storage and be shown on the favorite list page. In addition, the user can “unlike” any restaurant simply by clicking the red heart button on the favorite list page. To remove all liked the restaurant, simply click on the clear button. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h3> Development </h3>
                            <h4> Need Finding </h4>
                            <p>The activity we chose to observe was dining. Dining is a daily task that supports the basic functionality of our body and it contributes greatly to our health. And what matters is not just the quality of food, but also the whole dining experience. We wanted to study how people eat out, and the decisions that ultimately solve their verdicts of where they want to eat. As we observed and interviewed out subjects we broke our observations down. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Our main purpose was to figure out how different ingredients can dictate their food preferences, and what goals they have for why they chose what they chose. When we were observing, we realize that there are many factors to consider. Taste, pricing, health, spacing, locations, lines, time, and several other factors need to be taken into account. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p> We interviewed six subjects, from whom we found fifteen user needs. The two major ones are: </p>
                            <p> 1.Users  need  to  know  the  estimated  wait  time  of  their  orders  when  they  are  in  a  rush. </p>
                            <p>2.Users need to be able to agree on a mutual place with their friends so all party of members can feel more satisfaction. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Based on the needs we found, we developed out point of view, which is:</p>
                            <p>The UCSD community have problems planning around dining hours and settling in areas around campus due to the lack of information. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4> Prototyping </h4>
                            <p> We created two three story boards and two paper prototypes. </p>
                            <div class="wp-caption alignnone">
                                <img src="images/storyboards.png" alt="Objects by DeathStockPhoto - HiRes" />
                                <p class="wp-caption-text">Story Boards</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="wp-caption alignnone">
                                <img src="images/Prototype.png" alt="Objects by DeathStockPhoto - HiRes" />
                                <p class="wp-caption-text">Paper Prototypes</p>
                            </div>
                            <p> We also made a video prototype:
                              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGSRDtT9bco"> CLICK TO SEE THE VIDEO </a>
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4>Heuristic Evaluation </h4>
                            <p>Our team conducted heuristic evaluation on another team’s paper prototypes based on Nielsen's Ten Usability Heuristics,and we received feedback from our peers. We then identified potential changes based on those feedbacks:</p>
                            <div class="wp-caption alignnone">
                                <img src="images/changes.png" alt="Objects by DeathStockPhoto - HiRes" />
                                <p class="wp-caption-text">List of Proposed Changes</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4>Core Implementation</h4>
                            <p>Originally, we underestimated the complexity of the implementation and planed a few functionalities that we later found unnecessary regarding our major purpose. After re-organized our thoughts we decided to make “Waitless” clean and direct, focusing specifically on the wait time functionality and, as an add-on, the favorite list functionality for users to customize their experiences. We therefore changed our point of view to "with more comprehensive information on dining places, the UCSD community can better decide when, where and how to eat."</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>We first created two wireframes for our main functionalities:</p>
                            <div class="wp-caption alignnone">
                                <img src="images/wireframes.png" alt="Objects by DeathStockPhoto - HiRes" />
                                <p class="wp-caption-text">Wireframes</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Next we coded the skeleton webpage:
                              <a href="https://ste519.github.io/EatFaster/">CLICK TO SEE THE SKELETON PAGE</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p> And then we gradually added contents and details to the skeleton until we got our first testable version:
                              <a href="https://waygold.github.io/Waitless/home.html">CLICK TO SEE VERSION 1</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4> User Testing and Redesign </h4>
                            <p>After reviewing the notes from the two in-person tests, we conclude that one biggest problem of our app is the incomplete functionality of the heart button on current wait time page. Previously, our app does not support error prevention for the heart button, meaning that if our users click the button, they will not be able to unlike it immediately, but instead, have to navigate to the favorite list page and unlike it there.  Both of our test participants tried to unlike the restaurant right after they clicked on the heart button. This lack of error prevention leads us to our newer version of the app which allows users to unlike the restaurant immediately after liking it by clicking the heart button again. Also, in order to make the favorite functionality more recognizable to users, we added some shadow to the heart button. </p>
                            <P>

                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h4> Comparative Evaluation and Finalize </h4>
                            <p> From the data collected, we verified that the previous changes to our app (functionality of the heart button on the current wait time page) were meaningful. One of the major confounds is the order of version presented to the user. Although the influence brought by the confounds is hard to eliminate, we have discovered extreme cases where it took one user much longer using the original version, and another user couldn’t finish the task using the original version, both suggesting that the redesigned version is better. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p> However, we also found some potential changes that can make the flow of our app more fluent. For example, users point out that the layout of the wait time page made them think all the restaurants were clickable just like the previous page since they all looked the same. In addition, from the performance of the user doing the task, we found that the position of the clear list button was not easy enough for the user to find out. In conclusion, the comparative evaluation verified the significance of our previous changes and also provided us with more hints on how to further improve our app. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
